.. pigweed-module::
   :name: pw_build

The ``pw_build`` module provides a wide assortment integrations, tooling, and
libraries to address many common build system needs. Whether you're trying
to provide an easy way to group builds together, convert an ELF file to a .bin
file, or compile embedded binary data into a library or firmware image,
``pw_build`` is the place to look.

This module is also home to the :ref:`module-pw_build-workflows-launcher`,
a tool designed to simplify the management of various build system
configurations and expose developer-facing tooling via easy-to-use shortcuts.
This makes it easy to quickly customize project-specific presubmit flows, add
shortcuts for tools like Pigweed's :ref:`module-pw_presubmit-format` utility,
and prescribe build configuration variants supported by your project.
