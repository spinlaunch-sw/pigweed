/// A task which may complete one or more asynchronous operations.
///
/// The `Task` interface is commonly implemented by users wishing to schedule
/// work on an  asynchronous `Dispatcher`. To do this, users may subclass
/// `Task`, providing an implementation of the `DoPend` method which advances
/// the state of the `Task` as far as possible before yielding back to the
/// `Dispatcher`.
///
/// This process works similarly to cooperatively-scheduled green threads or
/// coroutines, with a `Task` representing a single logical "thread" of
/// execution. Unlike some green thread or coroutine implementations, `Task`
/// does not imply a separately-allocated stack: `Task` state is most commonly
/// stored in fields of the `Task` subclass.
///
/// Once defined by a user, `Task`s may be run by passing them to a `Dispatcher`
/// via `Dispatcher::Post`. The `Dispatcher` will then `Pend` the `Task` every
/// time that the `Task` indicates it is able to make progress.
///
/// Note that `Task` objects *must not* be destroyed while they are actively
/// being `Pend`'d by a `Dispatcher`. To protect against this, be sure to do one
/// of the following:
///
/// - Use dynamic lifetimes by creating `OwnedTask` objects that continue to
///   live until they receive a `DoDestroy` call.
/// - Create `Task` objects whose stack-based lifetimes outlive their associated
///   `Dispatcher`.
/// - Call `Deregister` on the `Task` prior to its destruction. NOTE that
///   `Deregister` may not be called from inside the `Task`'s own `Pend` method.
