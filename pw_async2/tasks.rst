Tasks are the top-level "thread" primitives of ``pw_async2``. This guide
provides detailed usage information about the :cc:`Task <pw::async2::Task>` API
of ``pw_async2``.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-background:

----------
Background
----------
For a detailed conceptual explanation of tasks, see
:ref:`module-pw_async2-informed-poll`. For a hands-on introduction to using
tasks, see :ref:`module-pw_async2-codelab`.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-subclasses:

-------------------
Concrete subclasses
-------------------
Pigweed provides the following concrete subclasses of ``Task``:

* :cc:`CoroOrElseTask <pw::async2::CoroOrElseTask>`: Delegates to a
  provided coroutine and executes an ``or_else`` handler function on failure.
* :cc:`CallbackTask <pw::async2::CallbackTask>`: Invokes a callback after a
  future is ready. See :ref:`module-pw_async2-tasks-callbacks`.
* :cc:`OwnedTask <pw::async2::OwnedTask>`: Gives ownership to the dispatcher
  when the task is :cc:`posted <pw::async2::Dispatcher::Post>`. The task must
  implement :cc:`DoDestroy() <pw::async2::OwnedTask::DoDestroy>`, which the
  dispatcher invokes after the task completes.
* :cc:`PendFuncTask <pw::async2::PendFuncTask>`: Delegates to a provided
  function.

You can also :ref:`create your own subclass
<module-pw_async2-guides-implementing-tasks>`.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-callbacks:

---------
Callbacks
---------
In a system gradually or partially adopting ``pw_async2``, there are often
cases where existing code needs to run asynchronous operations built with
``pw_async2``.  To facilitate this, ``pw_async2`` provides
:cc:`CallbackTask <pw::async2::CallbackTask>`. This task invokes a :ref:`future
<module-pw_async2-futures>`, forwarding its result to a provided callback on
completion.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-callbacks-example:

Example
=======
.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "pw_async2/callback_task.h"
   #include "pw_log/log.h"
   #include "pw_result/result.h"

   // Assume the async2 part of the system exposes a function to post tasks to
   // its dispatcher.
   void PostTaskToDispatcher(pw::async2::Task& task);

   // The async2 function we'd like to call.
   ValueFuture<pw::Result<int>> ReadValue();

   // Non-async2 code.
   void ReadAndPrintAsyncValue() {
     pw::async2::CallbackTask task(
         [](pw::Result<int> result) {
           if (result.ok()) {
             PW_LOG_INFO("Read value: %d", result.value());
           } else {
             PW_LOG_ERROR("Failed to read value: %s", result.status().str());
           }
         },
         ReadValue());

     PostTaskToDispatcher(task);

     // In this example, the code allocates the task on the stack, so we would
     // need to wait for it to complete before it goes out of scope. In a real
     // application, the task may be a member of a long-lived object, or you
     // might choose to statically allocate it.
   }

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-callbacks-considerations:

Considerations for callback-based integration
=============================================
While the ``CallbackTask`` helper is convenient, each instance of it is a
distinct ``Task`` in the system which will compete for execution with other
tasks running on the dispatcher.

If an asynchronous part of the system needs to expose a robust, primary API
based on callbacks to non-``pw_async2`` code, a more integrated solution is
recommended. Instead of using standalone ``CallbackTask`` objects, the ``Task``
that manages the operation should natively support registering and managing a
list of callbacks. This provides a clearer and more efficient interface for
external consumers.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-memory:

------
Memory
------
The memory for a ``Task`` object itself is managed by the user. This provides
flexibility in how tasks are allocated and stored. Common patterns include:

* **Static or Member Storage**: For tasks that live for the duration of the
  application or are part of a long-lived object, they can be allocated
  statically or as class members. This is the most common and memory-safe
  approach. The user must ensure the ``Task`` object is not destroyed while it
  is still registered with a ``Dispatcher``. Calling
  :cc:`Task::Deregister() <pw::async2::Task::Deregister>` before
  destruction guarantees safety.

* **Dynamic Allocation**: For tasks with a dynamic lifetime, ``pw_async2``
  provides the :cc:`AllocateTask() <pw::async2::AllocateTask>` helper. See
  :ref:`module-pw_async2-tasks-memory-alloc`.

.. _module-pw_async2-tasks-memory-alloc:

Dynamically allocating tasks
============================
:cc:`AllocateTask() <pw::async2::AllocateTask>` creates a concrete subclass of
``Task``, just like ``PendableAsTask``, but the created task is dynamically
allocated using a provided :cc:`pw::Allocator`. Upon completion the associated
memory is automatically freed by calling the allocator's ``Delete`` method.
This simplifies memory management for "fire-and-forget" tasks.

.. code-block:: cpp

   // This task will be deallocated from the provided allocator when it's done.
   Task* task = AllocateTask<MyPendable>(my_allocator, arg1, arg2);
   dispatcher.Post(*task);

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-implementing-tasks:

------------------
Implementing tasks
------------------
The following sections provide more guidance about subclassing ``Task``
yourself.

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-implementing-tasks-pend:

Pend() and DoPend(), the core interfaces
========================================
A :ref:`dispatcher <module-pw_async2-dispatcher>` drives a task forward by
invoking the task's :cc:`Pend() <pw::async2::Task::Pend>` method. ``Pend()`` is
a non-virtual wrapper around the task's :cc:`DoPend()
<pw::async2::Task::DoPend>` method. ``DoPend()`` is where the core logic of a
task should be implemented.

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-implementing-tasks-pend-state:

Communicating completion state
------------------------------
When a task is incomplete but can't make any more progress, its ``DoPend()``
method should return :cc:`Pending <pw::async2::Pending>`. The dispatcher will
sleep the task.

When a task has completed all work, it should return :cc:`Ready
<pw::async2::Ready>`.

.. note::

   How does a task wake back up? Tasks are not directly involved in this
   process. The task invokes one or more asynchronous operations that return
   :ref:`futures <module-pw_async2-futures>`, which are values that may not be
   complete yet. When invoking the async operation, the task provides its
   :cc:`context <pw::async2::Context>`. The future grabs a :cc:`waker
   <pw::async2::Waker>` from the context. When the future's value is ready, the
   asynchronous operation invokes the waker to inform the dispatcher that the
   task can make more progress. See
   :ref:`module-pw_async2-informed-poll-components-future` and
   :ref:`module-pw_async2-informed-poll-components-waker` for further
   explanation.

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-implementing-tasks-pend-cleanup:

Cleaning up complete tasks
--------------------------
The behavior of a task after returning ``Ready`` is implementation-specific.
For a one-shot operation, it may be an error to poll it again. For a
stream-like operation (e.g. reading from a channel), polling again after a
``Ready`` result is the way to receive the next value. This behavior should be
clearly documented.

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-passing-data:

--------------------------
Passing data between tasks
--------------------------
See :ref:`module-pw_async2-channels`.

.. _module-pw_async2-guides-debugging:

---------
Debugging
---------
You can inspect tasks registered to a dispatcher by calling
::cc:`Dispatcher::LogRegisteredTasks()
<pw::async2::Dispatcher::LogRegisteredTasks>`, which logs information for each
task in the dispatcher's pending and sleeping queues.

Sleeping tasks will log information about their assigned wakers, with the
wait reason provided for each.

If space is a concern, you can set the module configuration option
:cc:`PW_ASYNC2_DEBUG_WAIT_REASON` to ``0`` to disable wait reason storage
and logging. Under this configuration, the dispatcher only logs the waker count
of a sleeping task.
