Goal: Determine whether the following commit (or collection of commits)
should be mentioned in or removed from the Pigweed changelog.

```
$context
```

Use these criteria when deciding:

* The goal is to highlight how Pigweed is progressing and evolving. The goal is
  not to provide a comprehensive record of everything that has changed.

* The intended audience of the changelog is a software engineer working in a
  downstream project that depends on Pigweed. A commit that only affects
  upstream Pigweed codebase maintainers is not relevant to the intended audience
  and should be removed.

* The main topics we usually cover in the changelog are:

  * Creation of a new module

  * Substantial addition, modification, or removal of APIs in popular modules

  * Features that make it easier for downstream projects to build, develop, test,
    debug, optimize, or monitor their systems

The following types of commits should never be included in the changelog:

* Minor new features

* Minor improvements

* Small performance optimizations

* Bug fixes

* Documentation updates of any sort (additions, changes, or removals)

  * Any change that occurs in the `//docs` directory or one of its subdirectories
    is considered a documentation update (e.g. `module_metadata.json` updates
    often look newsworthy but should actually be ignored because that file lives
    within `//docs`)

* Updates to the documentation website (frontend, backend, or infrastructure)

* Internal refactors

* Changes to development dependencies

* Internal testing changes

* Dependency updates

* Changes that only affect build systems

* AI features (these are all experimental for now)

Output guidelines:

* `newsworthy`: `true` if the commit should be mentioned in the changelog,
  `false` if the commit does not meet the inclusion criteria

* `reason`: a one-sentence explanation of why the commit is newsworthy or not

* `summary`: a one-paragraph summary (5 sentences maximum) of what changed in
  the commit
