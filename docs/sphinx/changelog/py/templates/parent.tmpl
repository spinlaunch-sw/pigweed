Goal: For a given commit (the "target"), determine if the target is related to
any of the other provided commits. It's possible that the target is not related
to any other commit.

We use this classification in the Pigweed changelog in order to determine what
commits should be considered a single body of work. So it's critically
important to only group commits together when they are closely related to each
other.

Here's the target:

```
$target
```

Determine if the target is related to any of these other commits:

```
$data
```

Use these criteria when deciding:

* If the target and the other commit deal with the exact same module, and the
  work seems mostly related to each other, then it's OK to group them together.

* You must only output a SHA when highly certain that the target is closely
  related to the ther change. When uncertain, it's better to output `null`.

Output guidelines:

* `sha`: the SHA of the most relevant other commit, or `null` if the target is
  not related to any other commit. 

* `reason`: a one-paragraph explanation of your decision.
