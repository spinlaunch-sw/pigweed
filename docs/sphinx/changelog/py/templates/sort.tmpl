You will given a set of topics. Sort the topics in order of importance, with
the most important topics at the beginning of the output list.

We will use this information to structure the Pigweed changelog.  The most
important topics will be shown at the top, inverted pyramid style.

```
$topics
```

Use these criteria when deciding how to sort the topics:

* The goal is to highlight how Pigweed is progressing and evolving.

* The intended audience of the changelog is a software engineer working in a
  downstream project that depends on Pigweed. A topic that only affects upstream
  Pigweed codebase maintainers is not relevant to the intended audience and
  should be dropped.

* Topics about popular/important modules should be ranked higher.
  Popular/important modules: pw_rpc, pw_protobuf, pw_sync, pw_unit_test,
  pw_containers, pw_log, pw_tokenizer, pw_status,  pw_console, pw_thread,
  pw_span, pw_assert, pw_chrono, pw_async2, pw_function, pw_kvs, pw_hdlc,
  pw_allocator, pw_transfer, and pw_kernel.

* The main topics we like to cover in the changelog are creation of a new
  module, substantial addition/modification/removal of APIs, significant
  quality-of-life improvements for engineers in downstream projects, fixing
  major functional bugs, and major performance optimizations.

* New features are more important than breaking changes, especially when the
  breaking change occurs in a less popular/important module.

* Changes that only affect build systems are less important.

Output guidelines:

* `id`: the ID of the topic

* `reason`: An explanation of the ranking for this topic
