   :name: pw_bluetooth_proxy

The ``pw_bluetooth_proxy`` module provides a lightweight proxy host that
can be placed between a Bluetooth host and Bluetooth controller to add
additional functionality or inspection. All without modifying the host or the
controller.

An example use case could be offloading some functionality from a main host
located on the application processor to instead be handled on the MCU (to reduce
power usage).

The proxy acts as a proxy of all host controller interface (HCI) packets between
the host and the controller.

:cc:`pw::bluetooth::proxy::ProxyHost` acts as the main coordinator for
proxy functionality.

-----------
Get started
-----------
.. repository: https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#repositories

1. Add Emboss to your project as described in
   :ref:`module-pw_third_party_emboss`.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Bazel

      Bazel isn't supported yet.

   .. tab-item:: GN
      :selected:

      2. Then add ``$dir_pw_bluetooth_proxy`` to
      the ``deps`` list in your ``pw_executable()`` build target:

      .. code-block::

         pw_executable("...") {
           # ...
           deps = [
             # ...
             "$dir_pw_bluetooth_proxy",
             # ...
           ]
         }

   .. tab-item:: CMake

      2. Then add ``pw_bluetooth_proxy`` to
      the ``DEPS`` list in your cmake target:

Module configuration
====================
This module has configuration options that globally affect the behavior of the
:cc:`pw::bluetooth::proxy::ProxyHost` via compile-time configuration. See the
:ref:`module documentation <module-structure-compile-time-configuration>` for
more details.

Module configuration options include:

- :cc:`PW_BLUETOOTH_PROXY_MULTIBUF`: This module depends on
  :ref:`module-pw_multibuf`, and can use either the older v1 or newer v2
  MultiBuf API. By default, the v1 MultiBuf API is in use. When migrating to the
  v2 API, set the value of this option to :cc:`PW_BLUETOOTH_PROXY_MULTIBUF_V2`.
- :cc:`PW_BLUETOOTH_PROXY_INTERNAL_ALLOCATOR_SIZE`: The
  :cc:`pw::bluetooth::proxy::ProxyHost` can either use a provided allocator or
  provide an internal one. To use an internal allocator, set the value of
  this option to a non-zero value and omit the ``allocator`` parameter from the
  ``ProxyHost`` constructor invocation. When providing an allocator, it is
  strongly recommended to set the value of this option to zero to avoiding
  reserving space that will not be used.
- :cc:`PW_BLUETOOTH_PROXY_ASYNC`: This module supports two modes of operation,
  both of which provide thread-safe APIs. When this option is zero (the
  default), it will use synchronization primitives to allow for parallel
  execution. When this option is non-zero, it will asynchronously execute tasks
  using a provided :cc`pw::async2::Dispatcher`. When using this mode of
  operation, an allocator and a dispatcher must be provided that outlive the
  :cc:`pw::bluetooth::proxy::ProxyHost`.
